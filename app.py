    The DQW is an accelerator for the Quality AI Framework.
    Inspired by the CRISP-DM Framework, <b> QAIF </b> is a cohesive, generic framework that 
    can be tailored to a specific AI solution in a given context. 
    The framework is comprised of six gates that follow the process flow of the 
    AI project development cycle (CRISP-DM). The gates can be broken down into project phase, 
    processes, outcomes, governance and people. In each gate, there are specific tasks that need 
    to be completed for the gate to be passed through in order to enter the next gate.
    This ensures that each phase of the AI development cycle is validated thoroughly.
    
    You can access the app <a href = "https://share.streamlit.io/soft-nougat/sogeti_qaif/main/qaif_app.py"> 
    here </a>, to read about the Data Understanding and Preparation phase we 
    use the DQW for.

        <br>In the Structured data app, you can use PyCaret's class imbalance mitigation to 
        solve issues in structured data bias.      
        <br>Text data bias starts with assessing the documents for biased content by a human. 
        Then, you can use do an analysis on the word embeddings. If they carry bias,
        the model may give biased output. We are still working on adding this to the text data
        app. For now, we recommend checking out <a href = 'https://github.com/tdavislab/verb'>
